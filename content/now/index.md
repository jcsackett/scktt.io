I live in Frederick, MD--a not quite return to the DC area where I grew up.
Previously, I lived in Durham, a place I called home for 15 years.

I'm working for Snyk, in the Extensibility group, working to make sure the
Snyk API works well, scales well, and is a joy to use for anyone working on
their integrations, extensions, etc. For more about my work (now and history)
you can check out [my resume][0].

I am *trying* to restart the blogging habit, following Tom Critchlow's idea
around [small-b blogging][1].
