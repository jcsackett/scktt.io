Last night I read a *great* thread by [Cindy Alvarez][alvarez] on twitter
about effective communication at work. I'm reproducing it here, mostly so I
can find it later, b/c I don't trust tweets to stay around. You should go read
it over on [her timeline][@cindyalvarez] and give her some likes and retweets.

> 1/ Someone asked me for advice on effective async communication. Like any
> other project or skill, it's useful to work backwards. What's the desired
> outcome? How do we get there?
 
> 2/ What's the desired outcome of async communication? That the audience
> should read your message and know what to do next (and do it, ideally)
 
> 3/ First they need to know if this message is: - High priority / people are
> blocked until I do something - I need to answer this question - I need to
> confirm/approve something - There's an action I need to take - Confirmation
> that something happened - Details / FYI
 
> 4/ How do you achieve that in your async communications? I've got specific
> tips, but first a mindset: Start by forgetting about politeness. (Not
> permanently. Don't be a jerk. But start there.)
 
> 5/ Most business communication is terrible and we model off what we've seen.
> Plus, we're worried about making a good impression on our manager / that
> coworker we've never met. So we start with a lot of fluff. Cut it.
 
> 6/ Think about how you'd get your point across if you were blunt and
> demanding. "I need you to finish that doc today because no one else can work
> until you answer the open questions and we have an end of week deadline!"
> OK, great. That is very clear. Don't send it though.
 
> 7/ Now add politeness back in. - Keep 'what you need' at the start - Explain
> the "why" in terms of outcomes - Reduce friction (include links, use
> bolding, etc.) - Acknowledge any possible/known complications - Include
> emoji/gifs as appropriate - Thank generously at end
 
> 8/ For example, this would work for my workplace (not all!): By EOD today:
> please answer the open questions in doc (linked). We're blocked until we
> have your answers. I know your schedule has been crazy; let me know how I
> can help. Thanks so much! We appreciate it. ❤️
 
> 9/ A general tip that DOES work for all: whatever you've written, read it
> out loud. Does it make sense? Did you have to pause for breath in the middle
> of a sentence? (If so, it's too long.). Did you start with a bunch of
> warm-up chat? (If so, cut or move to the end)
 
> 10/ After you've written, read it out loud, (and then hopefully edited),
> then: - add tl;dr summary at top - Question: repeat it here - Call to
> action: link it here - Due dates: put them here - One line summary here and
> below, in the details, bold judiciously.
 
> 11/ Also - friendly chatter, getting to know people, building trust - all of
> that is wonderful and necessary! And also: if you make time to do that
> *separate* from looming deadlines and questions you need answered and work
> you're asking people to do, everything gets easier.
 
> 12/ A final thing - we often say "please do X task" when we want outcome Y.
> It's usually worthwhile to over-communicate a bit and mention both. Outcome
> is usually more important, but if you *only* talk about outcomes that can be
> too abstract for your audience.
 
> 13/ For example: "Please do X task, to make sure that we get Y outcome" or
> "I want to make sure that we get Y outcome. One approach may be to do X, but
> I trust you to figure out how to get it done" depending on who you're
> talking to / the situation.
